# hello-world
Let the world know we are just joining the coding camp!

Hi everyone in the coding world! I've long been attracted to coding...and have undergone some
researches in identifying major programming languages and career paths. Eventually, I ended up 
taking web devepment and android app development to pursue as my career paths (at least for the time being,
but heaven knows which one wins or outweighs in future). Then I got an idea that, in order to meet these goals, I needed to 
take up c (and some c++), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, MySQL, and all the associated development frameworks. I took some tutorials, read books, and did some hands-on exercises on some of these, and will continue to dive into each one of them to be armed with adequate knowledge and skill that one day, in the near future, I can become a full-fledged android and web developer.
